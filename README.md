This is just a short intro
Hence KNN is a completely non-parametric approach: no assumptions are made about the shape of the decision boundary. Therefore, we can expect this approach to dominate LDA and logistic regression when the decision boundary is highly non-linear. On the other hand, KNN does not tell us which predictors are important; we don’t get a table of coeﬃcients as in Table 4.3.
